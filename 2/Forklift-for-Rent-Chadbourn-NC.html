<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>

Motorized pallet jacks or manual pallet jacks are found in nearly every warehouse and are essential in many manufacturing and distribution work environments.</p>

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
<p>To simulate an operator, a 200 pound weight should be located with the center of gravity centered 40 inches above the operator's platform.

Usually, these lift trucks are free roaming, but can be set up for wire or rail guidance.</p>
