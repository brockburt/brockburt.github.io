Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>You may also ask to view the forklift's service record or work orders. Figure out whether you want to stick close to Ohio or are up for a road trip, and then consider one of these great vacation spots to visit in your lifted Jeep.
