<p>Counterbalance forklifts are probably the most common forklift trucks used in indoor warehouses and stores in the Vancouver area. While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>
<p>The higher its height limit is, the higher the price will probably be. Bucket trucks can offer aerial lifts that range from 34 to over 100 feet. Counterbalance forklifts are available in models powered by gasoline, batteries, propane, or diesel fuel.
