<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. We offer a range of financing options for companies who need a forklift now. In the UK, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations state that operators of forklift trucks must be adequately trained, the general standards of that training and good operating practice are found in the HSE Code of Practice 117 (Third edition) 49 issued in 2013.

<p>The fork lift truck used for the training at Coleg Menai is GAS OPERATED. Failure to secure truck or trailer with blocks can cause the trailer to move resulting in the forklift falling between the trailer and the dock.
