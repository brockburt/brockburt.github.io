We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>

Multi directional internal combustion forklifts are designed to handle palletized loads and long awkward loads up to 50,000lbs with ease.
