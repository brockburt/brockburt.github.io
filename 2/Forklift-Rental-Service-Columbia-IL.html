<p>I'd also like to say that I drive a truck, 2010 F-150 Platinum everyday to and from work and love trucks very dearly as I grew up driving them in Iowa. This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>
<p>The operator stands in the sideways compartment while the forklift loads on its side, making it easier to maneuver through tight spaces. Our full fleet of forklifts, cranes and hoists provide ample strength, lift height, versatility, and the performance features needed for most applications. We supply only high quality, safe, reliable equipment and forklifts and will facilitate everything from selecting the right forklift, helping with finance arrangements, to a seamless delivery.</p>

<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>Vertical masted rough terrain forklifts - If you're looking for a forklift that can be driven on uneven, muddy, or rough surfaces, this is the truck you need. Because of an intelligent man-machine interface, these versatile trucks offer enhanced visibility, acceleration and lift control, all of which are simple to programme. The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion.</p>

<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore.
