We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde.

<h2>Pallet Truck Albion</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful. However, to maximize the benefits you can gain from a short-term forklift rental, you need to understand lift truck rental agreements and how they align to the needs of your specific business. Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs.

<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes. Most kits include a standard or heavy duty compressor, a controller and all the hardware that you need to install the compressor onto your vehicle.
