<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc.

We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lifting Equipment Lake Park </h2>
<p>Up one spot to No. 13, Ireland-based Combilift, makers of four-directional forklifts, side-loading equipment and straddle carriers, grew 7% after selling 4,350 units in 2016, an 11.5% increase from the previous year. We are supplier, importer and exporter of 3- Wheel Electric Forklift Trucks (RCF). Alternatively, our LPG forklift trucks are flexible enough for both indoor and outdoor usages.</p>

In addition, reach trucks offer versatile benefits in various tasks for industries such as manufacturing industries, shop floors, transportation hubs, warehouses, logistics, and factories, owing to their compact design as well as greater maneuverability capability.</p>
<p>Ohio Power Tool carries a wide selection of jack stands (truck air jack stands, vehicle support jack stands, forklift jack stands, pin-type jack stands, and truck ramps) that offer capacities of 3-25 tons. Unlike most car repairs or upgrades, lifting a truck requires a little more effort than getting a few gearhead friends together on a Sunday afternoon to gather around a toolbox and a twelve-pack.</p>

<p>Xtreme's new range made it into Construction Equipment magazine's top 100 products awards for 2018. Whether you're using your forklift for manufacturing or retail, these brands offer better visibility, better safety and ease of use for faster overall performance. Options include side-loaders and turret trucks.

<p>With the Operator Presence Sensing (OPS) System, the reach truck becomes inoperative when the floor switch cannot detect the driver. For nearly 50 years, customers have relied on the Cat lift trucks brand for quality and reliable forklifts backed by exceptional service and support through its trusted dealer network. If your company has a forklift that's dead in the water, ForkliftTrader does on-site service calls.</p>
