Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,‚Äù for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse.
