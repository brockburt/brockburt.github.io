<p>Industrial reach forklifts are another common forklift, primarily used in warehouses. Only trained and authorized operators shall be permitted to operate a powered industrial truck. The best place to hire a forklift throughout Melbourne, Victoria and Australia. A reach truck helps operators to put pallets away at height in narrow aisles. The controls of a forklift consist of a series of levers which open and close valves on the hydraulic cylinders.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9‚Äù wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
