<p>Because extreme bounce can be a common problem in lifted trucks, we suggest continuously monitoring the bounce of your lifted truck. Give special consideration to the proper functioning of tires, horn, lights, battery, controller, lift system (including load engaging means, chains, cable, and limit switches), brakes and steering mechanism. However, you will need basic numeracy skills and to be able to speak, read and write in English well enough to do the training and forklift driving licence test explained above.</p>
