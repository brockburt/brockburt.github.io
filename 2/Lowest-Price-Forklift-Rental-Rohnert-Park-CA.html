<p>Toyota's industrial vehicle and equipment business started in March 1956 with lift truck production and sales in Japan. In the process of training I was trained to work the controls and the capacity of the weight of the mass.

<p>If you need a forklift ASAP, renting may be for the way to go, as you can eliminate the hassle of third-party financing or credit requirements. Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort.
