Also, 4,000 lb. trucks use a heavier battery to counteract the heavier load on the forks. The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>9. 9 Scope of Standard (continued) For marine terminal and longshoring industries, all powered industrial trucks are covered, no matter what specialized name they are given.

<h2>Osha Lift Training Haines City</h2>
