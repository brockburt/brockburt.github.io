<p>Both sit down and stand up style forklift trucks are included in this classification. U-Shaped Pallet Weighing scale are specially designed for handling pallets thus (No Pit, No ramps) required. Our forklift rental programme is backed by the strength and flexibility of our branch network. The difference is that only the mast moves and not the front tires like an articulated forklift.</p>

Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
