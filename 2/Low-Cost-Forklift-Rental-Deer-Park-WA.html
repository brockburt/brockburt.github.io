To avoid accidents, the operator should always remember to stack the loads evenly across the pallet and that they are balanced.

<p>Experience working in a warehouse or factory will be a bonus when applying for jobs as a forklift truck driver. Now, there are two great benefits that come with a lifted truck.

<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
