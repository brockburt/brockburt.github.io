Adding a suspension lift kit to your truck is a complex procedure that involves a lot of working parts. If you're looking for a little extra clearance and bigger, badder tires for the ultimate off-road experience, this might be exactly the lift you're looking for.</p>

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
