With rich industry experience, we are presenting our clients an optimum quality range of Multi Function Hand Pallet Truck. Lifted trucks not only offer a unique appearance but also provide practical benefits, particularly for drivers who like to go off-road with their pickups and tackle serious trails.</p>

<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets.
