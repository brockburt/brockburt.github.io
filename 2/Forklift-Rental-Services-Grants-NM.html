<p>Warning: An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. These low-reach forklifts are suitable for double floor stacking and low-level racking and shelving operations. For its loading capacity, it could deal with materials of up to 3300 lbs.</p>
<p>The greater suspension travel allows the vehicle to navigate rough, undulating surfaces with less of a chance of the body striking the ground or any object you're trying to drive over.
