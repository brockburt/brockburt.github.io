Automatic parking brake, electronic speed control and braking system provide enhanced driver safety and also contribute to the BT Pro Lifter's long operating life and low lifetime cost. Heavier loads shift the center of gravity forward even further.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>This lifting Equipment offers an incredible load capacity of up to 3000 kg allowing for swift weighing loads as well as transporting. Unique solution for mobile material handling and order-picking from pallet racks. A used stand-up narrow aisle forklift with a 300 lb. capacity and 212 inch lift height might cost around $7,000 to $9,000. Operating a rough terrain forklift carries an entirely new set of challenges compared to indoor use on a level surface.</p>

<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go. Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area. Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>
<p>Additionally, dealerships can warranty the work they do on their own vehicles - even lift kits. The capacity of a truck equipped with load carriage and forks, or with attachments is the maximum weight, expressed in pounds, at a specified load center, which a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable, on 406 of this Standard, can lift to the maximum elevation of the load engaging means.</p>
