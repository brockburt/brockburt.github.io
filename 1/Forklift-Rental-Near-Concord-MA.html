<p>Traction Control automatically adjusts the torque output of the motor for the reach truck. The truck class always sees a wide variety of entries due to a thriving community of truck enthusiasts with a broad palate for styling designs; from some of the lowest frame draggers you'll ever see to skyjacker lifts that seem to touch the sky.
