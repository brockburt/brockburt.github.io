<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>

Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
