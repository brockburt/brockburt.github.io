Optimum performanceWe are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Hand Pallet Hydraulic Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas.
