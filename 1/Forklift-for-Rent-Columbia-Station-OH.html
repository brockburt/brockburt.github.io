<p>If you are interested in Industrial Counterbalance Forklifts training, please get in touch using your preferred method and we'll be available to discuss your options. Means shall be provided for an operator on the elevatable platform to shut off the power to the truck.

<p>Speak to our representatives about finding the right lift truck and rental plan for your application. The most important part of choosing shocks for a lifted truck (besides knowing your truck's year, make, and model) is making sure you know the correct lift height. Linde offers a wide range of order picking equipment to suit all shelf heights, aisle widths, and order-picking methods.</p>
<p>If working spaces are tight and pedestrians or other trucks may cross your path, the braking system of a pallet truck must function perfectly. We carry a variety of pallet jacks, narrow aisle lift trucks, order pickers, and other cushion tire forklifts. We sell many of the leading brands of forklifts and other material handling equipment including Linde. Check your equipment before your shift because your fork lift is your responsibility, wear the proper gear, good footwear and a hard hat and enter and exit the forklift carefully.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>
