A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>

Our Military rough terrain forklifts incorporate above average safety & performance requirements designed to meet even the most rigorous military specifications, while our non-military rough terrain forklifts benefit from the trickle-down in technology that makes them exceptionally well-equipped in their category.</p>
