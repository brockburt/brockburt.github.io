That's why Linde develops entirely individual order pickers based on a modular system, featuring, for example, different mast heights, working platforms, chassis sizes, and operating and control concepts.</p>

In addition to 4WD forklifts and Sellick's poultry handlers , we occasionally have a used rough terrain forklift for sale.</p>
