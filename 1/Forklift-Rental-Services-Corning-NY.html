The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance. Delivery and pickup are not usually included in a forklift rental agreement. We employ a team of skilled professionals, who fabricate these products in varied configurations by using best quality raw material and progressive technology.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Gas-powered forklifts offer long service lives with relatively low maintenance costs. Efficient storage is an operational focus for many warehouse and industrial space owners and forklift trucks allow a company to make the most of their vertical storage capacity.

No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>

All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height. Heli is China's number one manufacturer of forklifts and 6th largest in the world. OSHA standards require that the employer ensure that forklift operator is competent to operate the forklift he or she is assigned to use.</p>
<p>Raymond pallet trucks execute versatile dock, horizontal and low-level order picking warehouse activities with five different available products—end rider, center rider, enclosed end rider, motorized walkie and tow tractor. You can avoid these charges by utilizing your own LP Gas tanks or filling up the fuel tanks prior to returning the rental equipment. In a warehouse, a forklift can navigate tight spaces, reaching areas that other vehicles cannot.</p>
