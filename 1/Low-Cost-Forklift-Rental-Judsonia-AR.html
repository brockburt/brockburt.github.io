Forklifts are commonly used in warehousing, storeroom, supply chain, and distribution environments. If you are a Private Individual looking to obtain a CPCS card for a Rough Terrain Forklift, the implications are very different from those of a CITB registered construction company.</p>
<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>

With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>The purpose of this standard is to promote safety in the design, construction, application, operation, and maintenance of powered industrial trucks.
