<p>Toyota forklifts stand out from the competition in one category.

This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.</p>
<p>The other concept to understand is the forklift's center of gravity. We rent the following forklift equipment: Caterpillar, Jungheinrich, and Harlo.
