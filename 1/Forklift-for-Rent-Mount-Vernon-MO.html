<p>With so many different types of forklifts , your workplace efficiency and productivity depends on selecting the right equipment for your needs. Dayton hand hydraulic pallet trucks are manually operated industrial duty products designed to lift maximum weight.

Buyer beware takes on particular importance when it comes to forklifts.</p>
<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift.

<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating. A loading plate for loading reference is usually located on the forklift. The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>The first thing when it comes to owning lifted trucks is to understand how you'd like to spend your money.

<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit. Yale has been manufacturing materials handling equipment for over 140 years. Since 1949, Kalmar has been the preferred brand among quality-aware, heavy lift truck drivers and owners. Most rough terrain forklifts have safety glass paneling around the cab, too.</p>
