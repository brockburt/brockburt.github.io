<p>These developments constitute a dramatic departure from the norm, according to Brett Wood , chairman of the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) and president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America. A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
