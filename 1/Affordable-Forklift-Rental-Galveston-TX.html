This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility.

<p>You can always combine the best of both worlds, however, by choosing a great off-road focused Chevy truck, and then getting it lifted for even better clearance and larger tires. Reduced Downtime At Your Facility - During scheduled or emergency repairs our Rental and Service Departments can work together to provide you with trucks on rent to cover your shifts while your machines are in the shop.</p>
